Persons with blindness have difficulties identifying what is in front of them without touching or asking someone. This creates challenges, especially when there's no one to assist or if the object in front of them is not to be touched. Solution should understand the requirements of the users and building an image recognition system.

# Solution Description
An Android Application which will let visually impaired users to know the place and localize it within the given frame of picture, we are using a pre trained network for our object detection algorithm MSCOCO.



 # Technologies Used
